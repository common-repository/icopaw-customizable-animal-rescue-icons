== Description ==

= Customizable animal rescue icons to use on all your Wordpress post and pages =

“icoPaw” is a free icon pack that I created specifically for animal shelters and rescue groups. Icons are not image files, but rather glyphs, meaning that they can be manipulated into any color or size you desire.  The plugin adds a button to your wp-editor that allows you to easily customize and insert the icons into your Wordpress posts and pages.


= Features =

1. Easy to customize - Icons come in are not image files, rather glyphs meaning you can change the color, background and size on the fly.
2. Easy to find what you need - Sort icons by category or search by keyword.
3. Easy to insert - After selecting your icon and styling it, simply click insert to place it in your post/page. Align it around your text and add a link if desired.

= Demo =

== Screenshots ==

1. Icons are not image files, but rather glyphs, meaning that they can be manipulated into any color or size you desire.  
2. Once you install the plugin, a new btn is added to your toolbar. When clicked, this window pops up allowing you to search for your icon.
3. Icons are sorted by categories: Animals | Call to actions | Content | Forms | Care | General actions | Social Media | Miscellaneous
4. Search by keyword to help narrow your results.
5. Click on the icon you want, and edit its color, shape, size, alignment. Then click on insert icon to place it into your WordPress page/post.

== Installation ==

1. Upload expanded icoPaw folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory

3. That's it! Go to any of your posts/pages and you'll now see a pink paw in your toolbar to start adding icons.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm unable to edit/add an icon in editor =
There are a few things to know:
- The plugin only works in Wordpress 3.9.1 and above
- The plugin only works in ie9 and above
- If you are in Firefox, you'll need to double-click on an icon to edit
- Make sure you have clicked into an empty space to insert an icon and of course to click on an icon first before choosing the edit option

= What if I want a different color or size that's not in the customizer options? =
If you know a bit of css,  you can simply add your own class to the icon's div or edit the styles in css/icoPaw.css.  Since the icons are glyphs, you can change the colors and sizes to whatever you need!

= How do I add a link to the icon? =
Once you have created the icon, click on it in the wp-editor, click on the pink paw and choose "edit selected icon".  You'll see a place to type in the Link Url. Make sure it is the full path to the page.  Example: http:www/mywebsite.com/pagename  
You can also specify the target.  For example if you want the page to open in a new window. type _blank into the target field.
